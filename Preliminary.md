## Initial setup

1. GitHub
   * Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/) if not already signed
     up. Pick default (free plan).
   * [Create ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) and link it with GitHub:
     - Ensure that you've created an SSH key if you do not already have one. (`ed25519` keys are recommended)
     - Make sure your public SSH keys are added to your GitHub account and that you can use them to access git repos
     - Do Not Share Your Private Key, in any circumstance
   * [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on [students repository](https://github.com/fdac25/students) so I
      can add you to the to the GitHub group for the course.
      
     - Start by [**forking** the students repository](https://github.com/fdac25/students)
     - Add your utk net id as NETID.md (click on '+' - add 
               new file next to the https://github.com/fdac19/students/ link)
     - Click on Create Pull Request (do not create NETID.md, but replace NETID by your netid in all lowercase, e.g. `bklein3.md` or `audris.md`)
    
     - If you receive a `Permission denied: publickey ` error, Add this to your ssh/config file:
       ```
       Host github.com
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/[your ssh key file]
       ```
       note: Your SSH key file is the one that doesn't end in `.pub`

1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. View, create, and edit your files
1. [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository


Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with
your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull

to ask a question â€“ just mention `@audris` with the question to make
