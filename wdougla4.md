I am William Douglass and I'm a Senior. My interests include baking, travelling, learning about Cybersecurity topics, and playing video games, especially Mario Kart 7 online. I'm not particularly active, but I'm learning how to play golf. Another, perhaps weirder, interest that I have involves learning about and trying to understand severe weather, such as hurricanes, supercells that produce tornadoes, and large winter storms such as the [1993 Storm of the Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Storm_of_the_Century). I hope to learn how to better clean and collect data so that I use it as I see fit (perhaps in a project related to hurricanes...).
