### Introduction

Hi! I am Valli Paladugu, a senior in Computer Science with a minor in Machine Learning. Some of my hobbies outside of academia are baking, listening/editing music, and dancing. Career wise, my current path is heading into software development but I like learning about machine learning and AI advancements so I would be interested in a career that is somewhat related to those topics. The reason why I am taking this class is because I want to learn how to do proper data collection and manage it properly. I have done two projects in the past were it would have been helpful to know how to search for, collect and use appropriate data. One project was about sentiment analysis and we had to find a good dataset and existing baseline model to replicate and use. However, me and those in my group had no where to begin when it came to data collection, so taking this class before then would have been helpful to figure out a good starting point. My other project also had the same issue where I didn't know where to find suitable data for my model so this class would have been helpful to have taken before taking on that class.
